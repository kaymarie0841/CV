    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a Research Associate in a clinical flow cytometry lab, and in an effort to learn about more
        ways to automate some of our non-laboratory operational processes, I decided to take courses in
        computer programming. In doing so, I have discovered courses in web development and have since
        been engrossed! I am currently taking courses on web development via LinkedIn Learning, Udemy,
        and Sololearn, and I love it so much that I am considering this as a potential side gig, if not
        ultimately a full-time career switch, once I become proficient enough.
    </p>
    <p>Besides being a science and computer geek, I am also a wife and a mother of two handsome little boys.</p>
